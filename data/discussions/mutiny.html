<h2>Architecture of Mutiny</h2>
<p>Mutiny is built on <strong>Godot 4.4</strong> using <strong>C#</strong> and features a modular architecture that
    enables easy expansion of game mechanics and content. The core gameplay revolves around a <strong>deck-building
        system</strong> where players acquire and upgrade cards to face increasingly challenging enemies.</p>

<h3>Data-Driven Card System</h3>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 2rem; align-items: flex-start;">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
        <p>Cards are designed as <strong>data-driven entities</strong>, with their behavior implemented through
            scriptable objects (<code>Resource</code> in Godot) and a flexible event system. This approach enables rapid
            iteration on game design while maintaining a clean and maintainable codebase : new cards and mechanics can
            be
            added without major code changes.</p>

        <p><strong>Example: The Blunderbuss Card</strong></p>
        <p>The data-driven architecture allows complex card behaviors to be defined declaratively. When the
            <em>Blunderbuss</em> card is activated:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deals <strong>10 damage</strong> (<code>DamageEffect</code>)</li>
            <li>Applies effects to the next cards in deck (<code>AffectOtherCardsEffect</code>):
                <ul>
                    <li>Sets them inactive (<code>InactiveEffect</code>)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Card descriptions are <strong>automatically generated</strong> from their defined effects, ensuring
            consistency across the entire card pool while enabling rapid creation of unique card combinations and
            strategic interactions.</p>

<h3>Rogue-lite Progression</h3>
<div style="display: flex; gap: 2rem; align-items: flex-start;">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
        <p>Mutiny features a rogue-lite progression system where players begin each run with a basic deck and build
            their arsenal through strategic choices. Each run presents encounters with escalating difficulty, requiring
            careful deck composition and tactical decision-making.</p>

        <h4>Card Pool and Rarity System</h4>
        <p>Cards are organized into <strong>five rarity tiers</strong> (1 to 5) that determine their power level and
            availability. As players progress, they unlock access to higher rarity cards offering greater strategic
            depth and powerful synergies. Card selection is governed by <strong>weighted randomness</strong> based on
            rarity distribution, creating unpredictable scenarios that enhance replayability and encourage adaptive
            strategies.</p>

        <h4>Statistics and the Bribe Mechanic</h4>
        <p>Players acquire permanent statistics that fundamentally alter their playstyle. The <em>Bribe</em> mechanic
            allows spending in-game currency to boost these stats, adding economic strategy to the gameplay loop. Each
            of the <strong>four main stats</strong> influences card drops and reward probabilities, creating
            personalized runs tailored to different playstyles and deck archetypes.</p>
